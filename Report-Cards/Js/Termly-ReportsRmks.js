/**
 * TIMING FIX:
 * Firebase is loaded via  <script type="module">  which is always deferred and
 * runs *after* classic scripts even if placed earlier in the HTML.
 * We therefore listen for the custom 'firebaseImportsReady' event that the
 * module script dispatches once window.firebaseImports has been populated,
 * instead of relying on DOMContentLoaded (which fires before the module runs).
 *
 * Safety net: if for any reason the event was already fired before this
 * listener registered (shouldn't happen with classic scripts, but just in case)
 * we also poll window.firebaseImports once on DOMContentLoaded.
